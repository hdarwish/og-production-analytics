# Task Overview

You are required to build a simple full-stack web application that meets the following criteria:

## Backend Requirements

Language & Framework: Python (you may choose Flask, Django, or FastAPI).
Data Source: Read data from a CSV, Excel, or any file format or database (you may use dummy or hardcoded data for this).
API: Provide the data via a REST API.

## Frontend Requirements

Framework: Angular.
User Interaction:
Include a form or input fields where users can provide parameters (e.g., date range, date, well name, region, etc.).
Add a button to trigger the API call using the provided parameters and display the retrieved data accordingly (e.g., in charts or tables).
Charts:
A table displaying the retrieved data.
A line chart to display oil production over time.
A map to visualize well locations (based on coordinates provided in the data).
any additional charts will be a bonus.
Styling: Use global CSS styles and adhere to best practices in structuring your styles.
Routing: Implement Angular routing for application navigation using proper guidelines (e.g., lazy loading if applicable, organized module structure).

## Optional (Bonus)

Add a small pop-up chatbot window on the frontend. This can have hardcoded responses and doesnâ€™t require backend integration.
You are welcome to include any additional features or enhancements that demonstrate your creativity, attention to detail, and full-stack proficiency.
